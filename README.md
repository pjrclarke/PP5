## About
This project is supposed to represent the scope of creating a e-commerce platform that would partner with spectacle making workshops. You can purchase handmade spectacles from the UK's only mass production workshop. The idea of this was quite large.

## Background
During the development of this project, I faced mental health issues which I chose not to address formally. Consequently, this decision affected my eligibility for student care support, as formal documentation was lacking. This meant I had very little time after overcoming my issues before the due date was in. I took time off during the course to try and reset myself and byt the time I was back I had little time to finish the course material and to complete this project.

## Development Journey
Given the circumstances, completing this project to this extent within a limited timeframe was challenging. Overcoming technical obstacles was one thing, but the primary struggle was regaining focus and productivity after dealing with personal issues.

## Inspirations
I drew significant inspiration from the walkthrough project "Boutique Ado," which served as the foundation for much of this work. 

## Additional Features
Incorporated into this project are several modal features, including user options for selecting different sizes, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience.

## Acknowledgements
I am grateful for the support received during this time, whether through understanding, encouragement, or practical assistance. Your support was invaluable.

## Reflection
In hindsight, I acknowledge that this project may be perceived as a retake. Nevertheless, I am disappointed in both myself and Code Institute for not recognising the validity of seeking help without formal documentation.

## Additional Features and Future Developments
- Privacy Policy: Incorporate a privacy policy to ensure compliance with regulations and build trust with users.
- Lens Options: Add options for users to select different lens types, expanding product offerings and enhancing customization.
- Shopping Bag: Implement features such as product removal and editing within the shopping bag for improved user experience.
- Admin Panel: Develop an admin panel allowing administrators to view orders and manage them efficiently. Integrate a QR tracking system for order updates via email.
- SEO and Accessibility: Enhance search engine optimization (SEO) and ensure full accessibility compliance to reach a broader audience and improve user experience for all.
- B2C and B2B Options: Introduce options for both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) transactions to cater to different customer segments.
- Payment Options: Integrate additional payment options to provide users with more flexibility and convenience during checkout.
- Chat function: create a chat function to talk with the workshop team
- Create a review page where users can leave a review of the store. 
- Full testing
- Research more into how to fully progress this by incorporating API's from software used in the workshop

## Conclusion
Despite the challenges, This project serves as a testament to resilience and determination. It highlights the importance of overcoming personal obstacles to achieve goals. Even though I was not able to complete what I wanted to accomplish. **Creating what I did in a day and a half hopefully shows some promise.**
